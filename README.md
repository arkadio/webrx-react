## Getting Started

* `npm install` -- _installs all required development packages_

### Gulp Commands

* `gulp help` -- _displays a full listing of all commands and overrides available_
* `gulp` -- _runs the webpack dev server with hot module reload_
* `gulp test` -- _runs the webpack dev server for the unit tests with hot module reload_
* `gulp test:watch` -- _runs the console test reporter in **watch** mode_

### Basic npm Commands

These `npm` commands will function without using gulp and perform basic build and test functionality. For context, the `npm` commands will not open a browser windows automatically and are much less configurable.

* `npm start` -- _runs the webpack dev server with hot module reload_
